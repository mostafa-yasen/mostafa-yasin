  bio: `Senior Python Backend Engineer with 6+ years of experience building scalable, secure, and high-performing backend systems across the MENA region and Europe.

I love solving complex backend challenges, optimizing performance, and mentoring junior engineers. I'm passionate about clean code and continuous learning.

Currently working at Gatewatcher (France), where I am a part of the development of a next-gen Cyber Security platform to detect and mitigate cyber threats (NDR, NBA, DGA). My work involves cloud security, real-time data processing, and building robust APIs using Python, Django, and modern DevOps practices.

Previously built learning platforms, ERPs, and payment solutions at Paymob, Majara, and JAWA HR using Python, Django, FastAPI, and the Frappe framework. I’ve also led technical teams and collaborated cross-functionally with Product and Dev teams to ship products that impact thousands of users.

Core Skills:
Python · FastAPI · Django · Django Rest Framework · Frappe · REST APIs · Linux · Microservices · Docker · Git · PostgreSQL · Agile · Cloud Security · Unit & Integration Testing · CI/CD · Gherkins · Functional Testing

I’m currently open to new opportunities in the Gulf region or Europe, and available for relocation or remote work.

Let’s connect if you’re hiring for senior or lead backend roles, or if you’re building something ambitious in Python!`,
